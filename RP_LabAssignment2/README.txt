This package contains the necessary files for the implementation and visualization of the Light-Up Puzzle, also known as Akari. The files provided are as per the assignment guidelines, which can be found at <https://www.dc.fi.udc.es/~cabalar/RP/current/ex1.html>, along with the main program "lightup.lp". Additionally, an adapted version of the "encode.py" script, named "encode_modified.py", is included. This modification adjusts the reference system to align with the output generated by clingraph.

To visualize the solution for a given Light-Up Puzzle, users should execute the command "show dom01.txt" in the terminal, replacing "dom01.txt" with the desired puzzle file name. We have updated the "show.bat" script to invoke "encode_modified.py" instead of "encode.py". This change corrects the orientation issue, preventing the visualization from being rotated 90 degrees clockwise.

Please ensure that all the scripts and files are in the same directory to guarantee proper functionality.
